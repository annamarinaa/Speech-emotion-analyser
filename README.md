# Speech-emotion-analyser
Main objective of the research is to analyze emotion from a speech data and also perform feature selection using Genetic algorithm.
Various classifiers like MLP classifier, support vector machines, decision tree, etc are used.
RAVDESS  dataset was used. 1440 audio files are present.
Emotions in the dataset : neutral,  calm, happy,  sad,  angry,  fearful,  disgust, and surprised.
Features extracted from audio are :MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), Mel spectrogram and Chroma. Totally 180 features are extracted.
Genetic algorithm is a type of evolutionary algorithm inspired by the biological theory of evolution.
Operators of genetic algorithm : Selection, Crossover, Mutation.

The K- Nearest Neighbour classifier performed well with an accuracy of 68%.
Genetic algorithm, which selected 103 features from 180 features and gave an accuracy of 78%.
